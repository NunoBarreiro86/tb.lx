QA Technical Challenge

I had authorization issues when trying to commit the project, so I had to upload a zip file with the test project.
Please unzip the Strava.zip folder to have access to karate test files. Test Cases, writen in Guerkin, are found in /Strava/src/test/java/features.

Please read the  "Instructions and Test Cases" document, to have access to the Test Case documentation.

You can also find the tests execution reports, in pdf file, for "activities" and "athlete" feature files.

Thank you
